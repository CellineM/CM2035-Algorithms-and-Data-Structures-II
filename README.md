Algo II Midterm 

Grade: A

A user-friendly interactive command-line tool for evaluating arithmetic expressions using postfix notation. The tool allows users to assign numeric values to variables A, B, and C, which are stored in a symbol table for subsequent use. Users can then input postfix expressions for evaluation, which the tool processes using a stack-based approach to ensure the correct order of operations. The system supports basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation, and includes error handling to manage incorrect inputs. The modular design of the program ensures that it can be easily extended with additional functionality in the future. Overall, the solution provides a clear and practical method for manually handling mathematical data, leveraging the efficiency and simplicity of postfix notation and stack data structures.
